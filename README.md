# Arduino Projects(You can simulate these with Arduino Uno on Tinkercad>> https://www.tinkercad.com/ )
## You can use Arduino Uno, Nano, Mega for recreating this, just the PWM pins should be connected carefully.
This section contains a collection of projects that use Arduino Nano, a small and breadboard-friendly microcontroller board based on the ATmega328 chip. Arduino Nano can be programmed with the Arduino IDE and has many features such as digital and analog pins, PWM, serial communication, SPI, I2C, and more. You can use Arduino Nano to create various projects such as games, robots, sensors, displays, and more.
## I'll also share the circuit diagrams with you.
## I'll be sharing the projects one by one, follow this series in order or get a good hold
## All the explaination will be present there within the code itself, the circuit diagram for the same will be updated in this Readme section.
## Prerequisites

To follow these projects, you should have some basic knowledge of electronics and Arduino programming. You should also have the following components and tools:

- An Arduino Nano board and a USB cable to connect it to your computer.
- A breadboard and some jumper wires to connect the Arduino Nano to other components.
- Some common components such as LEDs, resistors, potentiometers, buttons, switches, etc.
- Some specific components depending on the project, such as sensors, motors, servos, OLEDs, etc.
